# Women who Code - workshop



The code here was tested with Python 3.5, though most (but not all) will also work correctly with Python 2.7 and other older Python versions.

The packages needed to run the code in the notebooks are listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) (Note that some of these exact version numbers may not be available on your platform: you may have to tweak them for your own use).
To install the requirements using [conda](http://conda.pydata.org), run the following at the command-line:

```
$ conda install --file requirements.txt
```

To create a stand-alone environment named ``women-who-code`` with Python 3.5 and all the required package versions, run the following:

```
$ conda create -n women-who-code python=3.5 --file requirements.txt
```

You can read more about using conda environments in the [Managing Environments](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html) section of the conda documentation.
